# 2048_Game

2048 is a popular single-player sliding puzzle game . The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and players use arrow keys or swipe gestures to move the tiles in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right).

Here are the basic rules of the game:

Starting Tiles: The game begins with two tiles on the grid, typically with the values 2 or 4.

Tile Movement: Players can move tiles in the grid by swiping or using arrow keys. When a move is made, all tiles on the grid slide in the chosen direction, and a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in an empty spot.

Tile Combination: When two tiles with the same value collide while moving in a chosen direction, they merge into a new tile with a value equal to the sum of the original tiles. For example, if two tiles with a value of 4 collide, they combine to form a single tile with a value of 8.

Objective: The goal of the game is to keep combining tiles and doubling their values until a tile with the number 2048 is created. However, it's possible to continue playing beyond 2048 to achieve higher values and higher scores.

Game Over: The game ends when the grid is filled, and there are no more possible moves. Players can also lose if they are unable to create a tile with the number 2048.

Scoring: The score is determined by the values of the tiles on the grid. Each merged tile contributes to the score, and the highest possible score is achieved by reaching the 2048 tile.

2048 gained widespread popularity due to its simple yet challenging gameplay and the addictiveness of trying to achieve the 2048 tile. Many variations and implementations of the game have been created for different platforms and devices.
